  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.5": "“Bulb” renders _bhaṇḍika_. Normally I render this word as “bundle”, but here the intended meaning seems to be a “bundle” of cloves, that is, a single bulb of garlic. [Sp.2.793](): Dve tayo bhaṇḍiketi dve vā tayo vā poṭṭalike; sampuṇṇamiñjānametaṃ adhivacanaṃ, “Two or three _bhaṇḍika_: two or three bundles; this is an expression for being complete in cloves.”"
