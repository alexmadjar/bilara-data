  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc40:1.13": "Five or six _yojanas_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or approximately 13 kilometers (see “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon”, by Thomas Rhys Davids, p.16). Because of the lack of certainty, I use round figures rather than exact multiples of 13."
