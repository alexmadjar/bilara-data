  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65:2.1.8": "_Gihigatā nāma purisantaragatā vuccati_. The meaning of _gihigatā_ is by no means obvious. I take it to mean “one who has gone to a layman”, that is, someone who is married. The subcommentary, at [Vin-vn-ṭ.2365](), glosses _purisantaragatā_ as _purisasamāgamappatta_, “one who has attained cohabitation with a man”.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65:2.1.12": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such a _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
