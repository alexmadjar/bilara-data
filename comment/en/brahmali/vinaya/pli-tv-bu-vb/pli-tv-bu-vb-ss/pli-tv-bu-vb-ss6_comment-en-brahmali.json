  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.5": "I have rendered _muñja_-reed and _pabbaja_-reed with the single word “reed”. I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6": "The _sugata_ measures have historically been hard to pin down, something that still remains the case. The measures of length in ancient India were based on the physical body. It seems plausible, perhaps likely, that at some point this was thought too inaccurate to provide measures that could practically be used by Buddhist monastics in deciding important issues, such as the maximum size of their robes. I suggest, therefore, that the prefix _sugata_ was added to give a reliable “standard”, and thus my rendering. Moreover, the word _sugata_ does not necessarily imply that this standard is literally tied to the physical size of the Buddha. More likely, I think, the _sugata_ measures were *laid down* by the Buddha. They can perhaps be regarded as equivalent to the modern “king-size”, in that they provided an ample upper limit within which all monastics, regardless of size, would comfortably be able to function, whether in regard to robes, huts, or other requisites. For a more comprehensive discussion of these points, see [GIVE LINK TO ESSAY].",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:3.16.3": "The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries, e.g. at [Sp.4.294](): _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṃsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a _guhā_ made of rocks, a _guhā_ made of wood, a _guhā_ made of dirt.” And at [Sp.ṭ.3.294](): _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṃ pabbatānaṃ antarā, ekasmiṃyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṃ mahāvivaraṃ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them).” In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory."
