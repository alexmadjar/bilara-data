  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc87:1.11": "The _sugata_ measures have historically been hard to pin down, something that still remains the case. The measures of length in ancient India were based on the physical body. It seems plausible, perhaps likely, that at some point this was thought too inaccurate to provide measures that could practically be used by Buddhist monastics in deciding important issues, such as the maximum size of their robes. I suggest, therefore, that the prefix _sugata_ was added to give a reliable “standard”, and thus my rendering. Moreover, the word _sugata_ does not necessarily imply that this standard is literally tied to the physical size of the Buddha. More likely, I think, the _sugata_ measures were *laid down* by the Buddha. They can perhaps be regarded as equivalent to the modern “king-size”, in that they provided an ample upper limit within which all monastics, regardless of size, would comfortably be able to function, whether in regard to robes, huts, or other requisites. For a more comprehensive discussion of these points, see [GIVE LINK TO ESSAY].",
