According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.3": "Here I render _sugata_ as “Buddha”, which seems required by the narrative. I do not think, however, that this narrative usage ties our hands in the interpretation of this term. See note further down on my interpretation of the word _sugata_ in this context. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.15": "_Sugata-cīvara-ppamāṇaṃ_, “the _sugata_ robe measure”. The _sugata_ measures have historically been hard to pin down, something that still remains the case. The measures of length in ancient India were based on the physical body. It seems plausible, perhaps likely, that at some point this was thought too inaccurate to provide measures that could practically be used by Buddhist monastics in deciding important issues, such as the maximum size of their robes. I suggest, therefore, that the prefix _sugata_ was added to give a reliable “standard”, and thus my rendering. Moreover, the word _sugata_ does not necessarily imply that this standard is literally tied to the physical size of the Buddha. More likely, I think, the _sugata_ measures were *laid down* by the Buddha. They can perhaps be regarded as equivalent to the modern “king-size”, in that they provided an ample upper limit within which all monastics, regardless of size, would comfortably be able to function, whether in regard to robes, huts, or other requisites.
