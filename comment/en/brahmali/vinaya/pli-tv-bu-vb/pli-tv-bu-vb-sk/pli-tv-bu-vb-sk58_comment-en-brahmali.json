  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk58:1.5": "_Majjhimassa purisassa catuhattho daṇḍo_, “It is a stick of four forearms of a man of average height.” The metric measure given here is based on my own estimate of the _hattha_, “the forearm”, as 40 cm. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we further assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm."
