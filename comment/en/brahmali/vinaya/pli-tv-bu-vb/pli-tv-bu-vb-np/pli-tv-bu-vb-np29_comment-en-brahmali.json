  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np29:2.7": "The text reads “five hundred bow lengths”, _pañcadhanusatikaṃ_. [Sp-ṭ.2.1.92](): _Ācariyadhanu nāma pakatihatthena navavidatthippamāṇaṃ, jiyāya pana āropitāya catuhatthappamāṇa_, “A measure of nine hand-spans of an ordinary hand, or a measure of four forearms when the bowstring is attached, this is called the Teacher’s bow length.” According to [Sp.1.92]() the teacher’s bow length is the standard measure for bow lengths: _Ācariyadhanunā pañcadhanusatappamāṇanti veditabbaṃ_, “A measure of five hundred bow-lengths is to be understood according to the Teacher’s bow length.” According to Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary (s.v. _dhanu_), too, one bow length is equivalent to four _hatthas_ , or four forearm’s lengths. Following my own estimate of the _hattha_, the forearm, as 40 centimeters, this gives 800 meters for five hundred bow lengths. I arrive at the length of the forearm as follows. According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we further assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm."
