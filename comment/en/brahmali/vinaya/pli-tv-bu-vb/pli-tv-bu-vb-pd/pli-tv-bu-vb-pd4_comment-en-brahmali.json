  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:2.12": "It is hard to make out from the Pali what the announcement is about. The crucial word _appaṭisaṃviditaṃ_ can be read as an adjective qualifying _khādanīyaṃ_ and _bhojanīyaṃ_, in which case it is the food that needs to be announced. Alternatively, it can be regarded as an independent sentence verb, in which case it would seem that it is the risky and dangerous nature of the dwellings that needs to be announced. The word commentary in part supports the former interpretation, whereas the origin story supports the latter. Given this uncertainty, I have opted to translate according to what seems to make the best sense.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:3.1.2": "The text reads “five hundred bow-lengths”, _pañcadhanusatikaṃ_. One bow length, according to Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary, is equivalent to four _hatthas_ (s.v. _dhanu_), or four forearm’s lengths, sometimes rendered as “cubits”. The figure of 800 meters is a result of my calculation of the forarm as 40 cm. The calculation of the forearm, the _hattha_, is based on the following. According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we further assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm. ",
